# 🌐 Welcome to the Eclipse Oniro for OpenHarmony

**Oniro** is an Eclipse Foundation Project dedicated to the development of an open source vendor-neutral Operating System (OS) platform. The Oniro Project was established through a collaboration between two global open source foundations: The Eclipse Foundation and The OpenAtom Foundation. Leveraging the solid foundation of *OpenHarmony*, an open source project operated by the OpenAtom Foundation, Oniro builds upon an operating system platform known for its versatility across a wide range of smart devices.

The goal of this project is to build upon OpenHarmony, extending it with additional functionalities tailored for global markets. This collaboration between the Eclipse Foundation and the OpenAtom Foundation is aimed at driving the development and adoption of OpenHarmony on a global scale.
